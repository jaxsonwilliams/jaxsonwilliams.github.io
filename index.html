I was really encouraged to include all holidays instead of just having a Christmas theme so that's what I did. I included all the winter holidays I could think of and had all the celebratees sit around and have a meal. The final project was a bit rushed but I loved my characters too much to take this piece off my portfolio."

<h1>About Jaxson Williams</h1>
<p>
  I am a first year college student at the Cleveland Institute of Art and intend on majoring in Illustration. Although my plan is to go forth with Illustration, I don't particularly practice just one type of medium. I like to draw, paint, take pictures, build furniture, paint shoes, digitally create things, baking. As long as I get to make something I'm all in. I'm really enjoying expanding my horizons at CIA amd hope you enjoy my portfolio!
